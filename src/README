To build type:

To run unit tests type (will build scanner if not already built):

make test

make spimTest will run through a test program that includes recursive function calls, called within a for loop, whose return values are stored in arrays and later read out of these arrays and printed to the console.  The values produced through these function calls will eventually overflow the limits of my 32-bit words, but this is expected and handled reasonably (i.e. it doesn't blow up the compiler or spim). 

To clean (doesn't remove scanner executable):

make clean 

To clobber (removes lexer):

make clobber
